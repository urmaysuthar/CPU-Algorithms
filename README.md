CPU Process scheduling algorithms

This project involves implementing (i.e., simulating) several different process scheduling algorithms. The scheduler will be assigned a predefined set of tasks and will schedule the tasks based on the selected scheduling algorithm. Each task is assigned a priority and CPU burst. The following scheduling algorithms are implemented:

First-come, first-served (FCFS), which schedules tasks in the order in which they request the CPU./n
Shortest-job-first (SJF), which schedules tasks in order of the length of the tasksâ€™ next CPU burst./n
Priority scheduling, which schedules tasks based on priority./n
Round-robin (rr) scheduling, where each task is run for a time quantum (or for the remainder of its CPU burst)./n
Priority with round-robin, which schedules tasks in order of priority and uses round-robin scheduling for tasks with equal priority.
